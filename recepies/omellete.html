    <p>Omelettes are the most requested breakfast in our house and 99% of the time we always have the ingredients in the refrigerator. They are quick,easy an no special tool is needed to make them.In just few minutes your omlette is ready for you to eat.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Egss</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3> 
   <ol>
    <li><em>Beat eggs</em> – in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt then beat with a fork until frothy.</li>
    <li><em>Heat skillet</em> – place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. Once butter is melted and bubbly, add beaten eggs and reduce heat to low.</li>
    <li><em>Pull cooked eggs</em> with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the space. Watch the video tutorial above to see this process in action.</li>
    <li><em>Flip</em> – once eggs are nearly set, the omelette slides easily on the skillet and you can get a spatula underneath, flip it over. Turn off the heat.</li>
    <li><em>Fold</em> – add cheese and your favorite toppings, fold the omlette and slide it onto a plate to serve.</li>
   </ol>
