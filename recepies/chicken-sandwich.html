    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A homemade chicken sandwich tastes fresher because you aren’t re-using the same oil all day long. They are more satisfying than Popeyes Chicken Sandwich or even the famous Chik fil A.Just like homemade Burgers, these chicken sandwiches are a fun and inexpensive way to feed a crowd. This recipe makes 6 chicken sandwiches and the chicken patties reheat well so they are great for meal planning</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium chicken breasts, boneless, skinless, halved into 6 cutlets </li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk
        </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken cutlets between plastic wrap to an even 1/2” thickness for even frying.</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken – In a large mixing bowl, combine marinade ingredients, add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2-4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Dredge Chicken – In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together: flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. Lift a piece of marinated chicken, letting excess marinade drip off, and dip chicken into the flour mixture, pressing it on with your hands to coat well. Transfer to a wire rack. Keep the flour mixture for step 5.</li>
        <li> Heat 1-inch of oil in a soup pot or dutch oven to 350˚F. See our favorite oils for frying below.</li>
        <li>Re-dip the chicken into the flour mixture just before frying. Add chicken 2 pieces at a time so you don’t crowd.</li>
    </ol>
